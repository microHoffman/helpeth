## Contracts
Contracts are forked from [pimlicolabs/erc20-paymaster-contracts](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/erc20-paymaster-contracts).
We are overriding there a function that allows the remaining amount after paying of the gas to be sent to a different user (charity),
than the original transaction sender.
